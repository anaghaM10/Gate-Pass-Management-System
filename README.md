GATE PASS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
A gate pass management system in college is a web-based application that manages and tracks the movement of individuals out of a college campus. The gate pass system can be used to monitor the exit of students. Students request a pass from their faculty
advisor through the website, which can be approved by their parents through their login. Once the faculty advisor approves the gate pass request, it is then forwarded to the head of department for final approval before the gate pass can be issued. The security personnel will be able to view the list of students whose gate pass requests
have been approved.
